      "The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. There were no signs of life anywhere around them save for a lone horseman riding towards them. He was clad in leather armour and wore a black cloak that hid his face behind the hood. His mount was a dapple grey stallion. As he drew closer, the man raised his hand as if to stop the approaching travellers before letting go of the reins and turning his head away. He made no other move.\n",
      "'Is everything alright?' asked Amaranthe as she approached the man.\n",
      "He glanced back at her then continued his journey without speaking. She watched him until he disappeared around a bend. 'I think we are being watched.'\n",
      "'You think? I'm positive,' said Galdean.\n",
      "'Perhaps we should wait here until dark.'\n",
      "Amaranthe nodded. They could see only three buildings within sight. One had an open door and they could hear voices inside. Two more were set back off the road and appeared uninhabited.\n",
      "'Let's see what the villagers have to say about our arrival,' said Amaranthe.\n",
      "They walked down the hill to where the man had ridden. Amaranthe hoped the stranger would come back soon, because she wasn't sure how long they'd last if they waited. They stood just outside the shadows cast by the tall pines lining the road. No one came near them.\n",
      "It began to get dark. The wind picked up, carrying scents of pine sap and wet earth with it. Birds flew in great swarms above the trees. A few insects hovered close enough to touch. Their legs brushed against Amaranthe's skin as she moved among the trees, looking for any sign of life. She didn't find anything.\n",
      "She took a step forward. Something touched her shoulder. Her hand shot out to grab hold of the branch of a nearby tree. A second later, she felt something brush across her cheek. Then there was another soft sensation against her arm. She whirled around, trying to look everywhere at once. Nothing seemed out of place.\n",
      "'What is going on?' she whispered.\n",
      "Galdean grabbed her arm. 'Stay still!' He pulled her behind the trunk of the tree and crouched down so she wouldn't be visible from the road. She did the same beside him, though she couldn't help glancing out from time to time. Nothing stirred except for a flock of birds settling in for the night.\n",
      "When she next saw movement, it was not coming from the direction of the road. A figure emerged from between the trees ahead, walking slowly towards them. Amaranthe held her breath, afraid to breathe too loudly lest the person notice. It stopped several feet away and stared at them. The creature's hair fell past its shoulders and covered most of its face, but Amaranthe thought it looked similar to a woman, albeit much shorter than her. She wore a heavy shawl tied tightly around her neck to keep it warm. Her bare arms were covered in tattoos of vines and flowers, giving the impression she had been wrapped in vines and leaves herself. She also wore loose trousers tucked into boots that laced up to her knees, leaving her lower limbs exposed. When she spoke, it sounded as if her mouth were full of gravel.\n",
      "'Who are you?' she asked.\n",
      "Amaranthe hesitated. If she told this strange woman who they were, it might give her away. And even if she didn't know them, someone else might recognize her. What if they wanted to take her hostage? But the woman kept staring at them, so Amaranthe decided to chance it.\n",
      "'We're travellers passing through your area,' she answered. 'Where can we stay?'\n",
      "The woman cocked her head. 'Are you lost?'\n",
      "'No.' Amaranthe stepped forward and waved her hands to indicate they were friendly. 'We need lodging.'\n",
      "'Why do you want to stay with me?' the woman asked.\n",
      "'Because I don't feel safe travelling alone anymore. I've heard stories of bandits on the road and people disappearing while sleeping. We just want somewhere to rest.'\n",
      "'And why should I let you sleep in my house?'\n",
      "Amaranthe opened her mouth to answer but found she had nothing to offer. Was this supposed to be some test of character? Or was this woman simply lonely? 'Do you have children living with you?' she finally managed.\n",
      "'Yes.' The woman pointed to a small cottage further down the slope. 'My son is home. You may ask him.'\n",
      "Amaranthe swallowed hard. This was getting more difficult by the minute. 'Thank you.'\n",
      "As they started down the slope, Galdean put a hand on her shoulder. 'If we make camp tonight, we'll be less likely to attract attention. Maybe we can catch up with the man who warned us and see if he knows anything.'\n",
      "'Maybe we shouldn't go,' she said.\n",
      "'You don't trust the lady?'\n",
      "'Not really. Not after what happened with the man earlier today.'\n",
      "'That doesn't mean she wants to hurt us.'\n",
      "Amaranthe turned her head slightly to glance at the woman. 'Doesn't it?'\n",
      "'Well, yes,' admitted Galdean. 'But she does seem nice enough.'\n",
      "'She isn't exactly the most talkative person I've ever met,' said Amaranthe. 'She probably has a good reason for being quiet all the time.'\n",
      "'Or maybe she's shy,' suggested Galdean. 'After all, we don't know her.'\n",
      "'True.' Amaranthe sighed. 'All right. Let's try camping here tonight.'\n",
      "They reached the edge of the trees and found a spot sheltered from view of the road. The ground was soft under their feet and the air was cool. It reminded Amaranthe of her childhood days spent at summer camp. She wished she could share those memories with someone.\n",
      "'You know,' said Galdean as he knelt down to light their fire, 'there are many types of elves. Some are more like humans, others are very different.'\n",
      "'Really? Like what? I've never seen an elf before.'\n",
      "'There are a lot of creatures that look human but aren't.'\n",
      "'Like goblins?'\n",
      "'Right. Goblins are like half-breeds. They are the offspring of a human mother and a goblin father. Sometimes the father is human, sometimes a troll. Usually the mothers are humans, though.'\n",
      "'I'd never seen one before,' said Amaranthe.\n",
      "'Most people haven't. There are a few tribes of goblins. I think the ones we fought in the forest are part of the tribe that lives near Tethys Valley.'\n",

It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.\n",
      "\"That's not good,\" said Mira as she gazed around them. \"I'd hate to think that everyone had been slaughtered.\"\n",
      "\"Maybe we'll find survivors here?\" asked Cal.\n",
      "\"Not likely,\" replied Mira. \"If I'm right about what happened then most people have probably already left this place.\" She pointed towards one of the towers. \"Those look like siege weapons on top. They were used against our army, so whoever attacked us will still be here somewhere.\"\n",
      "Cal nodded his head. \"Let's go see who they are and if anyone is still alive.\"\n",
      "They made their way across the open ground between the river and the village before coming to a large wooden gatehouse blocking any further access to the settlement itself. From there they could just make out a couple of sentries patrolling the walls. One turned his head to gaze at them briefly, but quickly returned to his duties again without even looking away from the wall he was supposed to be watching. He didn't appear alarmed in the least that they were standing only a few paces outside the gates.\n",
      "\"Well, well, well,\" remarked Cal. \"Looks like someone has left these guys alone.\"\n",
      "Mira shook her head. \"We should keep an eye on them just in case they decide to attack us instead. We don't want to get ambushed while we're inside the gates.\"\n",
      "Cal took his bow off his back and nocked an arrow. \"Just stay close behind me, Mira. And no matter what you hear or see, do nothing unless I give the order. Understood?\"\n",
      "Mira gave him a nod. \"Yes, my Lord.\"\n",
      "\"Good girl.\" Cal stepped forward and shot an arrow towards where the guards were stationed on the walls. His aim wasn't bad, but neither was theirs and the archer easily avoided both arrows. Then, after waiting another minute for his target to return, Cal fired a second time. This time, though, he was rewarded with a grunt of pain from one of the men as the arrow found its mark. The other man spun round and raised his sword in defence, but by that point Cal had already taken a step forward and brought his own weapon down hard upon the man's head.\n",
      "He heard Mira let out a gasp of surprise, but otherwise kept quiet and continued to move forwards until he reached the entrance to the gatehouse. As soon as he passed through the doorway, the two soldiers came charging towards him, swords held aloft. Before they had fully closed the gap, however, Cal was already moving backwards. With each stride he drew nearer to the edge of the platform and closer to the edge of the drop-off below.\n",
      "One of the soldiers tried to bring his blade down onto Cal's shoulder, but the knight ducked under the blow and thrust his own sword straight through the soldier's chest. Another scream rang out from the dying man and he fell back, dropping his sword to clatter loudly against the stone floor of the tower.\n",
      "Cal wasted no time in pulling his blade free of the body and bringing it around once more to face the remaining guard. He parried a blow from his opponent's sword and then swung his own weapon upwards into the man's neck. Blood sprayed everywhere as the guard collapsed to his knees and toppled forwards onto his face.\n",
      "\"There's nobody else inside,\" called Mira, appearing next to Cal. \"It looks like they've all left.\"\n",
      "Cal glanced over the side of the building to confirm that she was right. There was nothing but empty air far below. He couldn't imagine how such a thing would come about, but something told him that whatever had killed everybody else here wouldn't hesitate to take the three of them out too if they stood much longer.\n",
      "\"Come on,\" he said to Mira. \"Let's check inside the village to see if we can find anything useful.\"\n",
      "Mira followed him up the steps leading up to the door of the gatehouse and pushed it open. Inside they could clearly see the bodies of several dead villagers lying scattered across the floor. Cal was glad that he hadn't yet seen any of their own fallen soldiers, although he knew that many must still lie buried beneath the rubble of buildings destroyed during the fighting.\n",
      "They crossed the main square of the village and entered one of the larger houses which lay on the outskirts. It appeared to have been partially burned down, so Cal immediately suspected that whoever had done this might have also been responsible for the destruction of their own homes. That seemed unlikely, but given the fact that the attackers had apparently set fire to everything else, Cal wondered whether the two events might somehow be connected.\n",
      "As they approached the centre of the room, they saw a large group of skeletons sitting on the floor around a table. On top of the table was a map of the surrounding area marked out with red pins stuck into the different locations. Cal recognised it instantly as the same one that they had studied earlier, only now the pins had all been removed and the whole map was covered in thick black ash.\n",
      "\"Someone burnt the entire village,\" observed Mira. \"And then they went back to burn it again. I guess we know who did this.\"\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" agreed Cal. \"Whoever these people are, they're not nice people. Let's try to find some clues as to who they are. If they were here long enough to plan out an invasion, then they must have left records behind somewhere.\"\n",
      "They began to search the house and its contents, looking for anything that might help them identify who had attacked their army. They found a few old books and papers, but they weren't exactly written in the common tongue. Mira looked at Cal expectantly and he nodded his head.\n",
      "\"You read the language?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Cal. \"But I'll be able to figure it out eventually.\"\n",
      "\"Do you think we'll ever be able to understand what they're saying?\"\n",
      "\"I doubt it.\"\n",
      "\"Oh,\" she said sadly. \"I'm sorry, my Lord. I thought you were better than that.\"\n",
      "\"I am better than that,\" said Cal. \"At least I hope I am.\"\n",
      "\"Then why didn't you learn to read?\"\n",
      "Cal frowned. \"I don't need to read. I'm a soldier, Mira. I don't need to sit in a classroom and study. I'm here to fight battles, not to read about them.\"\n",
      "\"I see,\" she replied. \"That makes sense. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, my Lord. I'll respect your wishes.\"\n",
      "Cal nodded his head. \"Thank you.\"\n",
      "He turned to leave the room and make his way back outside, but he stopped suddenly when he heard a strange noise coming from somewhere deep within the building. A moment later, a pair of glowing yellow eyes appeared in the shadows and gazed out at him.\n",
      "\"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice. Cal jumped slightly at the sound, but he was already prepared for any possible attack and quickly drew his sword.\n",

It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They rode past without slowing.\n",
      "\"It looks abandoned,\" said Kael. \"Do you think that's wise? There are probably traps set here.\" He pointed to one of the towers. Its roof had caved in and its walls were covered in moss.\n",
      "\"I don't see anyone guarding it,\" she replied.\n",
      "\"Perhaps we should go back. We can take our time looking around.\"\n",
      "She shook her head. \"We've come too far now. Besides, if there is danger, I'll feel better knowing what we're dealing with before we go inside.\" She dismounted and walked toward the nearest building, where the ground was covered with grass instead of dirt. Her boots crunched loudly as she approached. As soon as she entered the door, it swung closed behind her. She turned around and saw no sign of it.\n",
      "A man stepped out from behind an overturned barrel. His long black hair fell across his shoulders, framing a face made for war. His eyes were dark brown, and he wore a short leather coat decorated with silver studs. A sword hung at his hip, and he carried a spear in one hand and a bow and quiver slung over his shoulder. He grinned when he saw them. \"Well met! And welcome!\"\n",
      "Kael took a step forward. \"Who are you?\"\n",
      "He bowed low. \"My name is Kalis. I'm glad to have you here. My home has been empty these many years.\" He gestured toward the house. \"Please, come inside.\"\n",
      "They followed him through the open doorway into the main room. The floor was polished wood, and the walls were painted white. An old woman stood in the corner knitting woolen scarves. She glanced up as they entered, then quickly returned her attention to her work.\n",
      "\"Is this your wife?\" asked Kael.\n",
      "Kalis nodded. \"Yes, my dear. Come closer so I can see you properly.\" He moved to stand next to her, and the three travelers drew nearer.\n",
      "She smiled at them and waved her hand in greeting. \"Welcome, strangers. You must be thirsty after riding so far. Please help yourselves to something cold to drink. Tea, perhaps?\"\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Kael. \"But we're not here to drink tea.\"\n",
      "Kalis raised a bushy eyebrow. \"Oh?\"\n",
      "\"That's why we came.\"\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\"\n",
      "\"You told us your story earlier,\" said Amelie. \"About how you've lived alone since your parents died, but you know about the dragon.\"\n",
      "\"How did you hear about me?\" asked Kalis.\n",
      "Amelie explained. When she finished, he stared at her for a moment. \"Why didn't you say anything sooner?\"\n",
      "\"We thought you might want to tell us yourself.\"\n",
      "\"And yet you decided to come anyway.\"\n",
      "\"To be honest, I wasn't sure it would be safe. But it seemed wrong to just leave you here. No matter who you are, I think everyone deserves a chance to live free.\"\n",
      "His expression softened. \"Then I thank you. This place will be yours until I decide otherwise.\" He put his arm around his wife and kissed her forehead.\n",
      "Kael cleared his throat. \"So…do you have any idea what happened to your parents? Do you remember anything?\"\n",
      "Kalis shook his head. \"No, nothing. I was only eight when they passed away. It was hard enough losing them both. Losing their memories was even worse.\"\n",
      "\"Can you tell us where they were going when they disappeared?\" asked Amelie.\n",
      "\"Of course.\" He rubbed his chin. \"I was living with them in the town of Arisa. That was near the southern edge of the kingdom, and we never went very far. One day they left and headed north, but I don't know why. It was weeks later before I heard the news.\" He paused for a minute, staring down at the floor. \"I don't recall much else. I suppose I could try to ask my father again. If I knew more…\"\n",
      "\"Maybe,\" said Amelie. \"But right now, we need to focus on finding the dragon. Will you help us?\"\n",
      "\"Certainly. I owe you my life twice already. What more could I possibly do?\"\n",
      "Kael held up a finger. \"One last thing. Can you show us where your parents camped out when they first found the dragon's lair?\"\n",
      "\"Camped out?\" He frowned. \"There weren't any campsites near the entrance. Why do you need to find one?\"\n",
      "\"Because we're going to dig it up,\" said Kael.\n",
      "\"Dig it up?\"\n",
      "\"Yes. To make sure it hasn't been disturbed by anyone.\"\n",
      "Kalis shook his head. \"Not likely. Nobody goes there anymore. Not even the dragons themselves. They prefer the other side of the mountain.\"\n",
      "\"Which is?\"\n",
      "\"The eastern side. In the forest.\"\n",
      "\"Really?\" asked Kael.\n",
      "\"I wouldn't be surprised if that was where the dragon originally came from. It seems logical.\"\n",
      "\"Where does the path lead?\" asked Amelie.\n",
      "\"From the south end of the lake, there is a trail that leads into the woods. From there, the trail disappears, and the ground becomes uneven.\"\n",
      "\"Good,\" said Kael. \"Let's go.\"\n",
      "The two of them mounted their horses, and the four rode off together. Kael kept a close eye on the trees as they walked along the lakeshore. There was no sign of anyone watching them, but he still felt uneasy. They had ridden all the way to the northern border of the Kingdom of the Isles, and they were still being watched. He wished they'd brought a guide, someone who knew the area, or better yet, a tracker.\n",
      "Amelie was scanning the surrounding forest, too. She pointed toward the ground. \"Look there, between the roots of the tree.\"\n",
      "He peered into the thick foliage and saw what she meant. A large hole was dug into the earth, and the ground was littered with bones and scraps of clothing. \"Looks like they were searching the ground. Did you find anything?\"\n",
      "\"I don't believe so.\" She pointed toward the back of the cave. \"It looks like there is another exit there. Let's check it out.\"\n",
      "They rode back and dismounted. Kael walked to the rear of the cave. The opening was large enough for several men to pass through side-by-side. He leaned forward and pushed against the stone. The rock creaked, but it didn't budge.\n",
      "\"Do you have a shovel?\"\n",

A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.\n",
      "\"This is where we will begin,\" said Lord Vellorin, his face set in a grim expression as he led them down the path that ran along the water's edge towards the town. \"If you are willing to put your lives on the line then I can promise you this; there will be no one else here who can help us.\" He paused and glanced back at his men before continuing. \"I would prefer if only those who were truly dedicated to this quest joined us but we cannot force anyone. If someone wants nothing more than to live a simple life without being drawn into these troubles then so be it. You have my thanks for even coming here today. We shall make sure everyone gets what they want in return for joining our cause.\"\n",
      "Lord Vellorin led them around the shore until they came to an area of the shoreline that had been cleared of underbrush. Here stood a large stone structure that was easily three times the height of a man and almost twice as long. From its base rose several tall pillars that reached upwards towards the heavens and ended in a great dome above which floated a single enormous crystal that shimmered with an inner light.\n",
      "\"We call this place the Temple of Light,\" said Lord Vellorin as he walked past them. \"It was built by the people of the city of D'Rhin many years ago but now it stands empty except for a few priests who come here once a year to cleanse the crystals and perform the rituals needed to keep them intact. There is also a room beneath the temple that contains the heartstone that keeps the power flowing through it and a small chamber behind that which houses the book of prophecies.\" He stopped just inside the doorway and turned to look at his men. \"Are you ready?\"\n",
      "They nodded silently as they stared ahead into the darkness within the temple. They could hear the sounds of the river flowing nearby and the birds calling to each other but otherwise there seemed to be no one about.\n",
      "\"Remember, there is no turning back once we enter the temple,\" continued Lord Vellorin. \"There is no way out of here save through me and I am not going to let any of you leave. If you choose to remain outside the temple then I will do everything in my power to stop you but you must know that your chances of survival are minimal. If you are still determined to stay, then please step forward and wait here.\" He smiled briefly before stepping further inside. \"Good luck gentlemen.\"\n",
      "A moment later the door shut and there was silence.\n",
      "\"Let us see how brave they really are,\" said Lord Vellorin softly.\n",
      "He stepped into the entranceway and began walking slowly deeper into the building, his hand resting lightly upon the hilt of his sword as he did so.\n",
      "\"Come on then,\" called Lord Vellorin loudly. \"What are you waiting for? Let us begin!\"\n",
      "His voice echoed eerily throughout the interior of the temple. His men followed him closely, keeping close together. None dared to turn their backs to the darkness that stretched out before them but none made any attempt to flee either. All waited quietly as they followed Lord Vellorin into the unknown.\n",
      "As they moved deeper into the temple, they saw that the floor was covered in fine sand that sparkled like diamonds. The walls glowed brightly with an inner light that made it seem as though they were walking through a tunnel of purest gold. As they went farther inwards, the light dimmed somewhat but the feeling of warmth and serenity remained.\n",
      "\"You're right,\" whispered one of the men nervously. \"I don't feel afraid anymore. This feels good.\"\n",
      "Another man added, \"I think we should continue on.\"\n",
      "Lord Vellorin laughed softly. \"I'm glad to hear that! Come on, we haven't much time left.\"\n",
      "With that he started moving faster down the corridor, leading his men onward. Soon they came to a crossroads where four paths branched off. Each branch had its own unique colour and Lord Vellorin led them to the red one. At first he kept walking straight but after a short while he turned left and followed the passage. After another ten minutes or so he took a right turn and found himself following a narrow passage between two towering columns. The passage was lit by a glowing ball of white energy that hung suspended directly in front of them.\n",
      "Lord Vellorin paused momentarily and glanced back at his men before speaking again. \"I hope you've all chosen wisely because there's no turning back from here.\"\n",
      "\"What if we chose wrong?\" asked one of the men timidly.\n",
      "Lord Vellorin shook his head. \"Then I'll take care of it myself but I doubt I'd survive doing it alone so I wouldn't worry too much about it.\" He frowned thoughtfully. \"I suppose I could always go back for you but I don't want to waste my time on such trivial things.\"\n",
      "After a brief pause, he resumed his walk down the passageway. A little while later he heard footsteps echoing through the corridor behind him. When he looked over his shoulder, he saw his men standing motionless. He couldn't tell exactly how many of them there were but there were certainly more than five.\n",
      "\"Well, well,\" said Lord Vellorin quietly. \"If it isn't the leader of this rabble. It's a shame I won't be able to kill all of you personally but I guess I can settle for killing you instead.\"\n",
      "The footsteps continued steadily towards him. He watched carefully but the figure never revealed itself.\n",
      "\"Why are you running away from me?\" shouted Lord Vellorin angrily. \"I didn't say anything insulting yet you still run. Do you know who I am? I am the most powerful wizard in all of the Kingdom. Even the High Priest has never seen my like.\"\n",
      "There were a few chuckles amongst his followers.\n",
      "\"Oh yes, that's quite true,\" agreed a woman. \"I've heard that story before. What a pity that it wasn't true.\"\n",
      "Lord Vellorin spun around quickly, his sword raised high above his head. \"Who spoke?!\"\n",
      "The woman smirked. \"I did. You should have listened when I warned you.\"\n",
      "Lord Vellorin lowered his sword and sheathed it. \"I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. You were right. My magic does not work here.\"\n",
      "\"Of course it doesn't,\" replied the woman. \"I told you that you would find nothing here. You might as well give up now and try something else.\"\n",
      "\"Give up?\" cried Lord Vellorin in shock. \"Do you realize who you're talking to? How dare you talk to me like this!\"\n",
      "Lord Vellorin felt his anger rising but he managed to hold it in check. He stared at the woman for several seconds and then turned to his men. \"I apologize for my outburst.\n",

It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They stopped just outside the village's walls and dismounted, tying their mounts off to an oak tree.\n",
      "\"Where are we?\" asked Argoen. \"What is this place?\"\n",
      "\"I'm not sure,\" said Thane. He had his bow drawn and was looking around as if he expected trouble. \"It looks abandoned.\"\n",
      "Aron stepped forward and began walking towards the gate. As soon as he reached it he turned and walked back, motioning for everyone else to follow him.\n",
      "\"What is it? What do you see?\" demanded Aron.\n",
      "Thane pointed down. In front of them, about halfway between the gate and the forest, was a large pool of water that was slowly turning black. There were several places where thin streams ran into it and then disappeared beneath the surface again.\n",
      "\"We need to go back!\" cried Argoen. \"That's poison! We can't drink it!\"\n",
      "\"I don't think so,\" replied Thane. His eyes darted across the area and landed on one particular stream. \"There's something odd going on here.\"\n",
      "He walked over to the stream, crouched down next to it and splashed his hand in it.\n",
      "\"You're right,\" he said after a moment. \"This isn't poison, it's some sort of magic liquid.\"\n",
      "\"Magic?\" asked Aron. \"But what does it do? Why would anyone pour something poisonous into a river?\"\n",
      "Thane shrugged. \"I have no idea. I've never seen anything like it before. I'll try and get a sample later, though.\"\n",
      "With that he stood and started heading towards the gate again.\n",
      "\"Wait!\" called out Aron. \"Let me come too.\"\n",
      "They continued on inside until they came to another set of wooden stairs leading up to the top floor of the tower. This time there was no door; instead, a single rope hung down from the ceiling, tied securely to the wall above them. They climbed up onto the first landing, which consisted of four stone pillars supporting a flat roof that was made of wood slats. On the other side of the room was another door. Thane approached it carefully, pulling out his dagger. When nothing happened, he opened the door and stepped through. Inside, a spiral staircase led upwards and a hallway stretched away ahead of them, ending in a pair of doors. Both of these doors were closed, however, so Thane moved on, searching the rest of the floor.\n",
      "At the far end of the hall was another stairway that descended deeper underground. After taking a quick look around, he returned to the main part of the tower, closing the door behind him.\n",
      "\"What did you find?\" asked Aron.\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" he replied. \"Just a bunch of old junk. There was some sort of altar near the back that seemed important enough to keep, though. Let's take a closer look.\"\n",
      "Once they'd gathered everything together, Thane took a closer look at the altar. He couldn't identify any runes carved into it but that didn't mean much since he hadn't been raised among elves who knew how to read such things. The only thing that really caught his attention was the shape of the stone itself. It reminded him of a dragon's claw, although not quite as big. It felt heavy, too.\n",
      "\"Do you know what this might be?\" he asked Aron.\n",
      "\"No, but let's bring it with us anyway. It may turn out to be useful later.\"\n",
      "They carried it back upstairs, put it in a chest and locked it away. Once that was done they went downstairs and explored the rest of the upper floors. Nothing special stood out except for a very interesting book sitting on a table in one corner. Thane picked it up and flipped through it, reading bits of it aloud to the others.\n",
      "\"In the name of the Great Dragon, we shall raise the armies of our people and march against the enemies of the realm! By my blood, by my sword and by my axe, I swear allegiance to the Great Dragon and pledge myself to his service!\"\n",
      "Thane sighed. \"I don't suppose there are any more of those?\"\n",
      "The group searched around but found none. They finally decided to head back to the ground level and leave via the tunnel they'd entered through earlier. Before leaving, however, Aron took the book with him.\n",
      "After getting back outside, they tied their horses up to a nearby tree and started following the trail. At first it followed the edge of the lake but soon diverged and headed eastward. As they traveled further and further inland, the air became cooler and thicker, becoming almost oppressive. Soon the path ended abruptly at the base of a cliff. It was hard to tell exactly how high it was because the trees grew close together on both sides. The only way down was to climb down a narrow ledge that had been cut into the side of the cliff. It wasn't long before they could hear the sound of running water below them, coming from somewhere deep within the forest.\n",
      "\"I thought this was supposed to be the River Tethys,\" remarked Aron. \"If that's true then we must be climbing upriver. How high are we now?\"\n",
      "\"Hard to say,\" said Thane. \"I can see the tops of trees growing all the way to the sky.\"\n",
      "Aron looked up and whistled. \"Wow, this place is huge!\"\n",
      "Thane nodded. \"It looks like we've reached the mountain range that runs along the border between our kingdom and the empire of the dark elves.\"\n",
      "\"Is that where we're going?\" asked Argoen. \"I hope not, because it doesn't look like the kind of place I want to visit.\"\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" agreed Aron. \"Let's just stay here and wait for the rest of the party to catch up.\"\n",
      "\"Why?\" asked Thane. \"We should continue on, find the others and go home. There's no telling what could happen if we stay here, especially if the dark elves decide to attack.\"\n",
      "\"Don't you think it's a little early for that?\" questioned Aron. \"Maybe they just haven't figured out that the valley has changed hands yet.\"\n",
      "\"Well, that's true, I guess,\" said Thane. \"Still, I'm worried about the dwarves. If they aren't here already, they probably will be soon.\"\n",
      "\"What do you expect them to do?\"\n",
      "\"I have no idea. Probably nothing. It seems like they usually just sit there and complain. Maybe they'll do that again, maybe they won't. I'm just glad they weren't on the same boat as us.\"\n",
      "Aron nodded in agreement and started walking down the slope towards the stream that ran beneath them. The rest of the party followed him, careful to watch where they stepped so they wouldn't fall off the edge.\n",
      "\"How are you feeling?\" asked Aron.\n",
      "\"Fine, thanks,\" replied Thane. \"What about you?\"\n",
      "\"Good, I think. Just a bit tired, that's all.\n",
      "\n",

A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They walked around the lake until they reached an island where a large building stood. One tower was slightly higher than the other so that it leaned away from it.\n",
      "\"This is the place,\" said Kael as he stopped beside one of the windows and stared inside. \"I think I've seen this before.\"\n",
      "Kael's eyes were closed, his head tilted back. His mouth opened and shut several times, and then he said, \"There! In the middle room!\"\n",
      "Rikka frowned. She couldn't see anything in the dark chamber beyond the window. She took her dagger from her belt and used it to pry open the wooden shutter. Light poured through it revealing a small chamber filled with furniture covered in dust and cobwebs. The ceiling rose up above them and there was nothing else in the room save for a single chair sitting in front of a table.\n",
      "She turned to look at him. He had been staring at the same spot on the wall since she'd pulled the shutter down.\n",
      "He nodded once and pointed to another section of the wall near the door leading outside. \"That's where I saw it last time. There are three holes there. Look closely.\"\n",
      "She squinted and saw what he meant. Three small marks were carved into the stone just below the edge of the window frame. She pushed her dagger against one of them and pushed hard. The mark slid sideways along the stone, leaving behind a deep scratch.\n",
      "\"What is this?\" she asked, turning back toward Rikka. \"Did you know about this?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"Why would anyone put those marks here? Are we supposed to go inside?\"\n",
      "\"I don't think so,\" said Rikka. \"We should get going.\"\n",
      "They both started walking across the courtyard. Kael followed behind Rikka, looking back over his shoulder every few steps to make sure the doors hadn't moved. When they got to the top of the stairs that led down to the main level of the tower, he paused.\n",
      "\"Do you hear something?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she answered, not taking her eyes off the floor. \"Someone's coming. We need to hide.\"\n",
      "She ran back upstairs to find a hiding place while Kael crouched low and waited for the person to enter the tower. After a moment, he heard someone shuffling around in the upper levels. Then he heard the sound of footsteps moving slowly downstairs.\n",
      "When the man came into view, he recognized him immediately. It was the same guard who had met them earlier in the morning. Kael held still and didn't say anything. He knew that if he tried to talk, he wouldn't be able to stop himself from giving everything away.\n",
      "\"It's nice to meet you again, my friend,\" the guard said as he approached Kael. \"How are you feeling today?\"\n",
      "\"I'm fine,\" answered Kael without moving.\n",
      "\"Good,\" said the guard. \"Now, do me a favor and give me your dagger. Just drop it to the ground.\"\n",
      "Kael did as he asked, watching carefully as the guard bent down and picked it up.\n",
      "\"I'll take care of it now,\" said the guard, putting his hand under his cloak and pulling out a long sword. \"If you try anything funny, I won't hesitate to cut you down.\"\n",
      "Rikka appeared from behind a stack of crates and stepped out in front of the man.\n",
      "\"Who are you?\" demanded the guard.\n",
      "\"I am Rikka,\" she answered, drawing her own sword. \"You may call me Mistress Rikka.\"\n",
      "The man gave her a quick glance before returning his attention to Kael. \"Let me show you how we greet guests here.\"\n",
      "The man charged forward, swinging his blade wildly in a downward arc. Rikka sidestepped it easily and brought her own weapon up, slicing at his wrist. The guard dropped his sword and grabbed his arm, trying desperately to keep her from cutting him any deeper. But he wasn't strong enough. She sliced right through his flesh and into the bone beneath. He screamed out in agony, dropping his sword and holding onto his bleeding wrist.\n",
      "As he fell to his knees, Rikka kicked him in the face. Blood spurted from his nose as he hit the floor and lay motionless. She spun around quickly and caught sight of Kael running toward her. He reached her in a second and wrapped his arms around her waist.\n",
      "\"Are you okay?\" he whispered into her ear.\n",
      "\"Fine,\" she assured him. \"Are you hurt anywhere?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" he lied. \"Just scared.\"\n",
      "Rikka smiled, leaning her head against his chest. She felt safe for the first time in a long while.\n",
      "\"Come on,\" she said. \"Let's go.\"\n",
      "Together, they climbed down the stairs and headed straight for the door at the base of the tower. Kael knocked on it loudly several times, making sure everyone within hearing distance could tell they were there. When no one responded, he pounded on the wood with his fist.\n",
      "After waiting several minutes, the door swung open. A woman stood in the doorway wearing a robe that was stained with blood. Her eyes went wide when she saw the bodies lying in the yard.\n",
      "\"Please come inside,\" she said.\n",
      "Kael and Rikka walked past her and entered the tower. As soon as the door closed behind them, the woman locked it from the inside.\n",
      "\"Where's the other one?\" Rikka asked.\n",
      "\"He's in the room next to yours,\" answered the woman. \"Is he all right?\"\n",
      "Rikka shook her head. \"No.\"\n",
      "The woman looked confused. \"What happened to him?\"\n",
      "Rikka hesitated. She wanted to lie but she also didn't want to cause problems for the people in the village. Finally, she decided to tell the truth.\n",
      "\"His throat was slashed. I killed him.\"\n",
      "\"Oh my God,\" the woman cried. \"You must have been terrified. I can only imagine what you thought was happening.\"\n",
      "Rikka nodded. \"It was awful. I never imagined I'd ever be in a situation like that.\"\n",
      "The woman crossed the room and hugged Rikka tight. \"I'm sorry this happened to you. I promise it will be taken care of.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" Rikka said.\n",
      "She released the young woman and took a step backward. The woman opened a cabinet and took out a pitcher. She poured two glasses of water and handed one to Rikka.\n",
      "\"Drink this,\" she said. \"It will help calm you.\"\n",
      "Rikka took the glass and drank half of it in a single gulp.\n",

      "The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.\n",
      "\"Is that where we are?\" Kari asked as she rode beside him. \"It looks so peaceful.\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he answered quietly. \"And I think you will find it is more than just empty houses.\" He pointed down to the water below them. \"That's where the river enters the lake, which leads into an underground cavern system that runs all the way beneath this entire mountain range. That is where the city lies hidden.\"\n",
      "Kari turned her mount toward the left side of the valley where the road led off between tall, thick-trunked pine trees. She could see a long, low wall stretching across the width of the road there and a pair of guards posted atop it. As soon as they came closer, one stepped forward to block their path.\n",
      "\"State your business here, travelers,\" the man said. His tone wasn't particularly threatening; in fact, it seemed almost friendly, if only slightly suspicious.\n",
      "Kari dismounted and approached him, still holding onto the reins of her horse. \"I am Lady Vanador and these are my companions,\" she told him. \"We were hoping to make our way to the capital and would like to speak to the governor about a few things before we do.\"\n",
      "\"A few things?\" the soldier repeated. \"You mean to say you have no particular purpose other than to visit the king? You aren't going to cause any trouble?\"\n",
      "\"No trouble!\" she replied sharply. \"If anything, I'm looking for someone who might have been involved in a recent matter. We're not here to steal anything or hurt anyone. All we want is to talk with the king and his council about whatever may have happened.\"\n",
      "The soldier studied her for a moment then nodded and gestured back behind him. \"Follow me. I'll take you to the governor himself.\"\n",
      "They made their way past the village and around to the right side of the valley where another set of guards stood watch over the entrance to the tunnel that ran underneath the mountain range. The soldiers there directed the party into the passageway that wound its way through the stone until they finally emerged outside the palace gates.\n",
      "Kari noticed immediately how much larger the building appeared once inside the walls. While there had been several buildings scattered throughout the valley, each one of them had been dwarfed by the sheer size of the main structure. This place was immense. She knew it was designed to appear that way because it served as both the seat of government and the home of the king. The great hall alone could probably hold a thousand people at once and still leave room for a dance floor. There were smaller structures nearby, though, that must serve as offices and meeting places for the councilors and the governor. They weren't quite as impressive, but even those were large enough to house hundreds of people.\n",
      "She followed the soldier through the doors into the main hall, where three men waited near the throne. One wore the uniform of a captain, while the others wore plain clothes, but they all looked well-dressed and prosperous. Two of them stared intently at something on the ground near the dais while the third spoke softly with the king. When he saw them coming, the king rose to his feet.\n",
      "\"Lady Vanador, welcome,\" he greeted them. \"Your reputation precedes you and I appreciate you bringing your friends along with you as well. I assume you've come to discuss a matter concerning Lord Vanador, yes?\"\n",
      "\"Indeed we have,\" she confirmed. \"My father has informed us that you know of a woman named Serenjolsa who recently took part in a plot against his life and yours. If you remember anything else about her or her involvement, please tell me now.\"\n",
      "The king rubbed his chin thoughtfully then shook his head. \"I can recall little else, other than what Lord Vanador already knows. Her name was never mentioned directly to me, nor did I hear it spoken by any member of my court. But I cannot imagine she wouldn't have spoken of herself if she had done something wrong. Did she say anything of note?\"\n",
      "Kari shook her head. \"Not really. My father believes she was working for someone else, perhaps trying to get information from him, but he doesn't seem convinced she actually killed him.\"\n",
      "\"Well, it is possible she didn't kill him,\" the king suggested. \"He could very easily have survived and fled somewhere. It's also possible he didn't die at all, despite appearances to the contrary.\"\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\" Kari asked.\n",
      "\"Serenjolsa has been known to play mind games,\" the king explained. \"In fact, she used to do so with my brother, Jarlaxle, when we were younger. He believed she had poisoned his food, so when he was feeling ill, he went to her chambers to ask her why. She gave him a potion to drink, which made him believe he was dying, so he fell unconscious. Once he woke up, however, he found that he felt perfectly fine. In fact, he was better than ever! So, of course, he couldn't understand why she would poison him without warning him first, so he demanded answers. Instead of giving him a straight answer, she simply disappeared. He spent years searching for her, but it was always just rumors that he'd heard that led nowhere. Eventually, he learned of her death, but that, too, proved false. He eventually concluded that she had faked her own death and lived on to continue playing her games, which she does quite frequently. Even after her death, there are rumors of her sightings everywhere. Some say she died long ago and that this is merely a trick of some sort.\"\n",
      "\"So, maybe she faked her own death?\" Kari asked.\n",
      "\"Perhaps, but there is no proof of such a thing. And, as I said, it isn't impossible that she might not have been the one who poisoned my brother. She was, after all, a very skilled liar. Perhaps she just played along to fool everyone. I don't know, but it seems unlikely that she could be responsible for killing my brother. However, there is a possibility that someone else might be.\"\n",
      "Kari nodded. \"Who could it possibly be? Who could stand to gain more than your brother?\"\n",
      "The king considered her question carefully, and Kari could see he wasn't sure of the answer. Finally, he sighed and said, \"As I said, there are many possibilities. Serenjolsa was a very intelligent woman and, as I said, a skilled liar. She might be behind this, but it's just as likely that someone else could have hired her, or that she may have been acting as a dupe for someone else entirely. Or it could just be a coincidence.\"\n",
      "Kari frowned and looked at the two guards. \"And you two, what do you think?\"\n",
      "Both of them shrugged helplessly. Neither one seemed to be able to give a solid reason for thinking the governor was involved, but neither one was willing to outright deny it either.\n",
      "The king nodded.\n",

A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They stopped outside one of the towers, where an old man was sitting on a bench near the entrance. He stood as soon as he saw them approach, bowing his head.\n",
      "\"Welcome, friends,\" he said in heavily accented Common. \"I am Elgar, steward to the people who live here.\" He smiled warmly, revealing teeth stained brown by years of tobacco. \"Please, come inside.\"\n",
      "They followed him inside. The room was small but well kept, with several benches and tables arranged around a fire pit that had been stoked just hours ago. Elgar took a seat across from them while Vaelin sat down beside him. \"This is my son, Yulien,\" Elgar said. \"He will take your horses back to our stables if you wish to rest before dinner. I'll have food brought up for you shortly.\"\n",
      "Vaelin glanced at the boy. His eyes were fixed upon the floor and his expression wary, though not fearful.\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" Vaelin said.\n",
      "\"Of course.\" Elgar turned back to him. \"How can we help?\"\n",
      "\"We're looking for someone,\" Vaelin replied. \"A woman named Dortia.\"\n",
      "Elgar frowned. \"You don't look like soldiers, nor are you dressed for travel. What brings you this far north? You shouldn't go so close to the border without more preparation than that.\"\n",
      "\"That's what I'm trying to find out,\" Vaelin said.\n",
      "\"I see,\" Elgar nodded. \"My name is Elgar; please call me Elgar. My father died ten years ago, and ever since then I've run this place alone. There's only five of us left now. We're a poor folk, but I do the best I can for those who need shelter and a meal.\" He gave a rueful smile. \"Not everyone appreciates what little we have to offer these days. As you may have gathered, times are hard. That's why I hope you won't mind if we keep things quiet until we know what your business here is.\"\n",
      "\"That's fine,\" Vaelin said. \"We'll speak plainly once we understand each other better.\"\n",
      "Yulien appeared at the door holding three packs, which he placed on the table between them. \"If there's anything else you want, you should let me know sooner rather than later,\" he added before retreating back into the hallway.\n",
      "\"What would you say if I told you that a group of men came here yesterday and attacked us?\" Vaelin asked.\n",
      "\"Attack?\" Elgar's frown deepened. \"Who did you say attacked you?\"\n",
      "\"Some men from the north called themselves the White Robes,\" Vaelin said.\n",
      "\"The White Robes?\" Elgar's face contorted in confusion. \"But the White Robes were wiped out ages ago. They used to rule this land. Every king and queen since has been descended from them. Do you mean to tell me there are still some left?\"\n",
      "\"It seems that way.\"\n",
      "\"And yet you say these men were not White Robes?\"\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\"Then I fear you must be mistaken. If they weren't White Robes, how could they attack you?\"\n",
      "Vaelin hesitated. \"There was something... different about them. Not just the robes and their manner of dress. But also their eyes. They had eyes like a wolf's, bright blue, and full of hatred. When I tried to fight them they disappeared. And then last night another man came here claiming to be a White Robe. He wanted to kill me.\"\n",
      "Elgar shook his head in disbelief. \"Impossible!\" He leaned forward, lowering his voice. \"The White Robes are gone. They never existed except in stories passed down from generation to generation. No man alive today has seen one. Even the stories were exaggerated, and many were nothing more than fabrications made up by bored children to entertain themselves.\"\n",
      "Vaelin stared at the steward in silence. \"Did anyone else hear the sounds coming from the tower last night?\" he finally asked.\n",
      "\"Sounds? No, no one heard anything. Perhaps they were too far away, or perhaps they were just illusions conjured by the man you met in the village.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps.\" Vaelin sighed. \"But it seemed very real to me. I think he really was a White Robe. I've never been wrong about such things before.\"\n",
      "\"Never?\" Elgar sounded surprised. \"Whyever would you make such a claim?\"\n",
      "\"Because I saw the bodies of four dead men lying in the street outside my home when I awoke this morning,\" Vaelin said. \"They wore white robes.\"\n",
      "Elgar looked troubled. \"That is odd, but hardly impossible. After all, we do get travellers passing through from time to time. Most of them are honest merchants, but occasionally we have troublemakers. If any of them were to turn violent, the others would intervene. It's not unusual to find blood on the streets when that happens.\"\n",
      "\"Four dead men? Four of the same kind of robe? I doubt it was bandits. Bandits usually leave their victims intact.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps not. Perhaps they were White Robes after all, and whoever killed them didn't care to spare them. Still, even if that is true, why would they try and murder you as well?\"\n",
      "Vaelin shrugged. \"I have my own ideas on that matter. It doesn't seem likely that the man who attacked us and his accomplices were simply random murderers. For one thing, they knew my name, and where I lived. The man I saw last night claimed to be a White Robe, but he wasn't acting like one. He was talking like a common thug. His companion, however, was a soldier. He spoke to the woman as though she was an equal, and he showed no sign of fear. She was terrified of him. So I believe that whatever their goal, they had a connection to me.\"\n",
      "\"Are you certain you saw a woman with them?\" Elgar asked. \"For all you know, she was just a servant or slave. Perhaps your attacker was her master.\"\n",
      "\"She was a woman,\" Vaelin said. \"As tall and strong as a man, with skin darker than a sun-bleached corpse. I'm sure of that much. She was wearing a dark grey gown with silver embroidery, and a sword at her belt. I saw that clearly enough. Besides, she was the first to disappear, so the others couldn't have been hers. And that's not all, Elgar. I know a little of the history of the White Robes and their successors.\n",

      "As they neared the base of the structure, Ryl felt something strange, as if the world was suddenly darker than normal. When he tried to look at the tower, the darkness became so intense he couldn't even focus on what he was seeing. With a start, he realized that it wasn't just him; the entire landscape surrounding the tower had become dark.\n",
      "Ryl's senses returned to him as quickly as they'd left and he could feel the warmth of the sunlight shining on his skin again.\n",
      "He turned to see Aran staring up at the sky with a frown etched across his brow. \"Do you see it?\" asked Ryl.\n",
      "\"See what?\" asked Taryn.\n",
      "Aran pointed to the sky. \"That cloud! It's moving!\"\n",
      "When they got closer to the tower, they found an open area inside between the walls of stone. In the center of the space stood a large tree growing out of the earth. Its branches spread out above them, reaching outward into the sky as if seeking sustenance from the clouds above.\n",
      "\"How can this be?\" asked Ryl as he stared up at the massive trunk.\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" answered Ryl honestly. \"But I'm not going to question it any further.\"\n",
      "Taryn knelt down next to the tree and ran her hand across its bark. \"This is beautiful,\" she whispered. Her tone conveyed a sense of awe that Ryl hadn't heard in quite some time.\n",
      "\"Are you sure about this?\" asked Aran.\n",
      "Ryl gave Aran a reassuring nod. \"Yes, I am. Let's try to stay close together though.\"\n",
      "After crossing the courtyard, they approached the door made of wood that led into the building itself. As they drew near, the feeling of being watched intensified, sending chills down their spines. Their hair rose on end and goosebumps formed across their arms and necks.\n",
      "Before anyone could say anything, the door swung inward with a loud creak. Inside, they saw a large hall with several doors leading off of it. The floor was covered with thick carpets and soft pillows lay scattered across the ground.\n",
      "Aran stepped forward and began walking deeper into the room while motioning for everyone else to follow. As they moved, the hairs on Ryl's neck stood straight up. The air grew heavy and oppressive and his stomach churned with unease. Something was very wrong here and he didn't want to risk running into whatever it was without knowing how to fight it off first.\n",
      "Suddenly, the sensation vanished as abruptly as it had come. All traces of uneasiness vanished and Ryl breathed a sigh of relief.\n",
      "The group continued following Aran until they reached a large table set in the middle of the room. There was another door behind it, but the others decided to wait outside.\n",
      "Aran walked past the table and opened the other door. Beyond the doorway was a long corridor lined with many rooms similar to the ones they'd passed earlier. Each held a single occupant sitting in front of a bed.\n",
      "The people were all women and most appeared to be elderly, though some might have been younger. Their clothes were simple but clean, and each bore a necklace containing a symbol engraved upon it. They were seated with legs crossed in chairs facing a central point in the room. On the far wall opposite them hung tapestries depicting scenes of the forest.\n",
      "Each woman wore a pendant dangling from their necks, and each of those symbols was identical to the one Ryl and his companions wore.\n",
      "\"What are these?\" asked Ryl, pointing at the symbols on the women's necks.\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" responded Aran. \"Perhaps someone will know.\"\n",
      "With that, Aran entered one of the rooms and closed the door behind him.\n",
      "The rest of the group waited outside for what seemed like hours until Aran finally emerged from one of the other rooms. He looked pale and shaken, his eyes wide and his expression fearful.\n",
      "\"There was one here,\" said Aran. \"She told me that I would find a way to save my family.\"\n",
      "Aran turned to face the rest of the group. \"Come on, we need to get out of here now.\"\n",
      "The three companions followed Aran through the hallways, avoiding the rooms where the occupants sat. At the end of the hallway, they came to a pair of double doors that led out onto a balcony overlooking the valley below.\n",
      "From where they stood, they could see the entire lake and beyond that, the mountains stretching up into the sky. The sun was just beginning to set in the west, painting the horizon orange and pink.\n",
      "\"Look!\" cried Aran excitedly. \"Do you see it?\"\n",
      "Ryl and his companions turned and looked in the direction Aran was indicating. A dark shadow had formed on the mountainside directly ahead of them.\n",
      "\"What do you think it is?\" asked Ryl.\n",
      "Aran shook his head. \"I've never seen anything like it before.\"\n",
      "\"I think it looks like a dragon,\" added Taryn, her eyes bright and her voice filled with wonder.\n",
      "\"You're right, it does look like a dragon,\" agreed Ryl. \"But dragons don't exist, do they?\"\n",
      "Aran nodded. \"They don't.\"\n",
      "\"Well, whoever or whatever that is, it's heading our way. We need to get out of here before it reaches the village.\"\n",
      "Aran turned to the others. \"Can you make it out of here before it arrives?\"\n",
      "Ryl and his companions glanced around. \"We should make for the forest, at least we'll be able to hide there.\"\n",
      "Aran looked out over the valley again and then turned back to the others. \"I agree, let's go.\"\n",
      "\"Wait,\" called Taryn from where she stood beside the door. She had her sword in hand and her eyes fixed on the dark shape in the distance.\n",
      "\"What is it, Taryn?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[[Text]]\n",
      "[[ID:ACE_HF_10]]\n",
      "The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They rode down toward the lake where the water sparkled under the afternoon light.\n",
      "\"What do you think?\" Ryl asked his companions as they dismounted. \"Should we head back? I don't know what we're going to find here.\" He looked around nervously at the empty village and the still waters of the lake.\n",
      "\"I'm not sure,\" Alara replied. \"But this is definitely not the place that I expected. There are no signs of struggle, no bodies, nothing that would suggest there had been any violence. This could just be an abandoned village; however, I have never heard of such a thing before. It's possible that there's something else going on here that we haven't yet figured out.\"\n",
      "\"Or maybe it's simply too early in the day to tell anything about them,\" Zera suggested. She walked her horse down to the shoreline. \"This looks peaceful enough.\" She pointed out towards the center of the lake where a small island stood alone.\n",
      "Ryl couldn't see any sign of anyone on the island but he did notice that the surface of the water rippled slightly as if someone were moving about on the other side. As he watched, a figure emerged from beneath the waves and swam to the shore. The woman climbed out of the water, shook off the last few drops and then began walking across the grassy plain toward the village. When she reached the edge of the forest line, she paused for a moment and then disappeared inside the woods.\n",
      "Alara stepped forward and spoke in a low voice. \"That seems strange to me.\"\n",
      "Zera shrugged. \"It may be nothing, but I will keep my senses open for anything that might prove otherwise.\" She nodded toward the woods. \"I'll take point while we investigate.\"\n",
      "She kicked her heels against her mount and led the way into the trees.\n",
      "As they moved deeper into the forest, the sounds of birds and animals filled the air. Their path wound between two large boulders until finally reaching a small clearing. Here, they stopped and listened. From somewhere deep within the trees, they could hear the soft sound of a river running through the ground below them. Zera motioned for them to wait and then took a few steps farther into the clearing. After listening intently, she returned to them. \"There is definitely a stream nearby. We should try to follow it upstream so that we can get a better sense of the area.\"\n",
      "They continued following the river upstream until it met another small creek. At first, they followed the banks downstream but soon found themselves traveling directly alongside the smaller tributary. It wasn't long before Zera spotted something sticking out of the water ahead. She pulled her bow from her shoulder and nocked an arrow. \"Stay close and watch your step,\" she said quietly before drawing the string back.\n",
      "Her aim was true and she shot straight through the floating object without hitting anything else. When she lowered her weapon, Ryl saw a dark-haired young man lying face down in the water. He quickly scanned the bank above him and saw several more bodies scattered among the brush. Each one appeared to be unconscious but breathing normally.\n",
      "\"We've got to move fast,\" Alara whispered. \"If they wake up, they will be a problem.\"\n",
      "The three of them silently made their way closer to the nearest body. With only a few feet separating them, the man opened his eyes and looked directly at them. His mouth dropped open in shock when he recognized Zera.\n",
      "\"Get away from her!\" he shouted, scrambling to his feet. He pulled a dagger from his belt and started making his way toward her.\n",
      "Without thinking, Ryl reached behind him and grabbed the hilt of his sword. He brought it around quickly, knocking the blade from the man's hand. Before he could react, Ryl drove his elbow backward into his stomach. He fell back onto his rear end, gasping for breath.\n",
      "\"You are dead,\" he gasped, looking up at Ryl with hatred in his eyes.\n",
      "Zera raised her bow again, preparing to shoot him again but Ryl held up his hand, stopping her. \"He is not our enemy,\" Ryl told her calmly.\n",
      "Before either of them could respond, a loud howl erupted from the opposite side of the clearing. The four men who had been watching the scene unfold now charged toward them. In less than a heartbeat, their weapons were drawn and ready. Ryl readied his sword, trying to decide which direction to go.\n",
      "\"Leave this place, or die!\" the leader screamed, advancing on them with his sword in front of him.\n",
      "Ryl didn't hesitate. He ducked under the man's swing and swept the blade upward, cutting deep into his arm. As he turned back to meet the charge, Ryl felt the sting of steel against his cheek. He spun around to block another blow but the man had already thrown his sword aside and taken hold of Ryl's arm. Ryl twisted sideways, forcing the attacker's blade to slide past his own. He then used the momentum to spin around and slam the man's wrist against the ground. With a quick twist of his hips, he threw the man over his head. The man landed hard on his back with a thud.\n",
      "The second man was coming at Ryl now, swinging wildly at him with the same short sword that the leader had been wielding. Ryl parried each of his strikes effortlessly and then thrust his blade into the man's chest. He let go of his opponent's throat as he fell back to the ground.\n",
      "Ryl looked around, searching for the next attacker. There were two of them left standing, both armed with swords. They backed away slowly, keeping a wary eye on him.\n",
      "\"Why are you here?\" one of the men asked, his tone showing little respect or fear.\n",
      "\"Where are you going?\" the other added.\n",
      "\"Back to the village. That is where we're supposed to be.\"\n",
      "\"That's where we're going too. We are not afraid of you.\"\n",
      "\"Well, I am. I have a wife and children that need me. I'm going home.\"\n",
      "\"Not without us.\"\n",
      "\"You want to come with us?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I do.\"\n",
      "\"Then fight me like a real warrior.\"\n",
      "The men exchanged a look before rushing at him together.\n",
      "Ryl barely had time to bring his sword around before they attacked. Both blades slashed across his torso, slicing flesh and leaving shallow cuts. Without missing a beat, Ryl countered with a slash of his own. He caught the man's blade on the downward stroke and knocked it out of position. He followed this attack by sweeping his leg, catching the other man in midair and sending him crashing to the ground.\n",
      "As Ryl prepared for the third man's assault, he noticed that there were no more bodies in sight. \"Did you kill everyone?\"\n",
      "\"No, they ran when we killed the others.\"\n",
