# Excerpt 1 (Ouroboros)

I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was thin, long-nosed, and had sunken cheeks that almost disappeared under its gray skin. Its lips were pulled back in a wide smile and it held one hand out toward me as if beckoning me closer. As the other hand slowly traced its fingers down my cheek, I backed away, scared by what I saw reflected in the glass.
/As I turned and ran for the door, the mirror began to shatter into thousands of tiny shards. I fell down on the floor and felt them slide under my skin like hundreds of tiny needles. In just seconds, they traveled down my body with all their little sharp ends reaching through the surface of my skin to the inner depths. I closed my eyes tight as the pain started to build, but as soon as the pain hit my mind, the glass began to move under my skin again. The shards began to crawl up my arms and legs toward my heart as I tried to scream but no sound would come out.
\I could feel the glass crawling along my neck, finally making it up to my mouth and biting deep into my tongue. I was trying to pull it out but it kept growing larger and more painful. I opened my eyes wide so I wouldn't miss any of the pain as it reached its peak. I opened my mouth to cry out when it pierced my brain. I stopped screaming, I didn't have the strength to even close my mouth anymore. As it began to devour my brain, the pain finally came to an end. I opened my eyes to see myself in a bright light as I was slowly dying.
\The sound of knocking came from behind me as a second face appeared in the mirror. I could tell it was an older woman by the wrinkles and gray hair. She had a thin smile on her lips as she waved one hand at me. When the other hand went through the glass, my body followed its motion. As the glass began to pull us apart, we looked into each other's eyes for a moment before it pulled away.
\When the glass stopped moving, the world around me was quiet. It was as if time had stopped as well. I saw the gray skin man standing next to the old woman with both their hands reaching for me. They wanted me to come closer.
\"Don't touch me!" I screamed. "Get your hands off of me!" But they were already too late. Their skin pulled through the glass and grabbed me, pulling me into them. I tried to fight back, but they had me now.
\As our mouths met, the gray skin began to fill my mouth and the old woman smiled. I felt as if my whole body was on fire as the glass started to melt in my mouth. My teeth broke off and slid down my throat, trying to escape. When they reached my stomach, I could feel the sharp edges begin to cut. I knew what this meant and began to beg for death as the world faded to black.
\I woke up to find myself in bed. The clock told me that I had slept for almost four hours and it was now 6:00 p.m.. I jumped out of the bed, running to the mirror to check if I was still alive.
\The glass had not returned and my reflection showed no sign of gray skin or anything else. It was just like the first time I'd looked into the mirror, except the light was off. I turned the switch on and the mirror glowed with a bright white light, making the room brighter than it should have been at night.
\I ran out the door, scared and confused. When I got back to the house, the sun was coming down. I walked inside and took a quick shower. When I got out, I went over to my computer and looked at my email.
\I was shocked to see a new one from my boss asking me to work late into the night because some documents had been misplaced. I decided to stay late since it was getting late anyway.
\When I got back, I took another look around for any trace of the ghost that I had seen in the mirror. I couldn't find anything. After eating dinner, I lay down to try and get some sleep. Before I dozed off, I heard something like knocking on the glass and then felt a tug on my heart. I tried to open my eyes but they wouldn't move. Something had hold of me and wouldn't let me go. I could feel it's mouth on mine as it drew my soul through my tongue to devour it.
\As I slowly died, I began to see a light appear in front of me. I opened my eyes wide so I wouldn't miss anything, but nothing appeared. I closed my eyes again, trying to wake myself up, but still I couldn't move. In my last moments, I saw the light and knew what it meant. The gray skin was now pulling me through my stomach and into the center of my brain.
\In an instant, I was gone. I felt no pain. I simply woke up to find myself in the middle of a cornfield staring into the mirror. My reflection stared back at me with a wide smile on its face. It was wearing a suit and held a briefcase in one hand, tapping it against the glass. As it continued to tap it, I felt the tug of my heart as the gray skin began to pull it through my body. When it reached my throat, I opened my eyes wide in fear as I screamed.
\The mirror shattered into millions of pieces, letting me fall on the ground. I began to scream for help, but the ghost kept pulling me into its mouth, waiting for my soul to be eaten. The sky began to turn black as night fell over the cornfields and the moon was just rising above the trees.
\I looked up into the sky and saw a figure standing on top of the cornstalk, looking down at me. Its arms were stretched out in front of it. As I watched, it raised its hands above its head and pointed at me with a finger. The next moment, I was ripped away from the mirror, pulled through the glass, and then sent flying into the air. I hit the ground and rolled before stopping.
\When I got to my feet, the cornfield around me was covered in blue flames as I turned around to look at where the man had appeared from. When I saw him, he was gone and so was everything else. I felt my heart as I stood up and slowly walked back to my car, not knowing what to do.
\It was about two hours later when I heard knocking on my door. My wife answered it and there was a police officer standing with her.
\"Can I come in?" He asked.
\She stepped aside and let him pass. When he closed the door, I could hear him walking toward the kitchen.
\"Why did you lock your bedroom door this morning?" The officer asked. "And why didn't you answer us when we knocked?"
\I started to explain, but she interrupted me. "I told you, the door was locked."

# Excerpt 2 (Ace of Spades)

I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had a large nose that looked like an elephant's trunk with two large nostrils. The mouth was small and thin. Its eyes were small, but they seemed to be staring straight through me. There was a long black hair covering its head. This wasn't just any old man. It was a demon! I screamed and ran downstairs. My parents came running as well, and my dad called 911. We all stayed together in our living room waiting for the police. They said someone would be here shortly.
\It was only ten minutes later when the doorbell rang. I opened it to see the sheriff standing outside. He asked if he could come inside. As soon as he stepped foot inside, he fell to his knees and began screaming. He then grabbed my father by the shirt and started shaking him violently. All this time, I'm still sitting on the couch holding my mom's hand. After a few seconds, the sheriff calmed down and sat back in his chair.
\"What happened?" My mom asked. "Is everything okay? Did something happen to you guys?"
\"No," the sheriff replied. "We're fine. We have another situation going on right now."
\My mom gave us a confused look and went upstairs to her bedroom. I followed after her and found the sheriff lying on the floor with a knife sticking out of his chest. My mother knelt next to him and pulled it out. Blood poured out of him as she held the wound closed with both hands. She looked at me and said, "This isn't real. You must get up!" Then, she pushed me off the bed and onto the floor.
\She turned to the sheriff and said, "Get up. Get up or we will die here today!" He didn't move. She took one last glance around the house before she left. Everything disappeared except for myself. I was floating above the ground and watched the whole thing play out. Once the sheriff finally stood up, he became a monster too. He grabbed his wife by the neck and slammed her against the wall. He threw her across the room where she hit her head hard against a dresser. His body shook as he cried out. I wanted so badly to help them. But how could I? If I did, I'd end up dead.
\The sheriff picked up a baseball bat and beat his wife repeatedly. Finally, he stopped moving. I could feel tears rolling down my cheeks. How could he do this? Why would he hurt such a beautiful woman? Tears streamed down my face as I floated closer to the ground. Soon, I was falling through space. A bright light appeared ahead. I reached out towards it as I felt my life slipping away. That's when I realized that I wasn't dying; I was being reborn.
\My new life is far better than what I ever could've imagined. I live in a big house with many rooms. Each of them are filled with different people. Some are demons while others are angels. I can choose which ones I want to spend my time with. It's been almost five years since I was born. In that time, I've learned that not everyone is good. There are some who seek to take advantage of those who need them most. There are also those who are evil enough to kill their own family members without a second thought. Yet, I am lucky because I have the power to protect them. I am blessed enough to have a family that cares about me.
\They say that the devil never sleeps. But I know he does. And he has plans to destroy everything that is good in this world. I hope someday I'll be strong enough to stop him once and for all. Until then, I'll continue protecting those who cannot fight for themselves. I'll continue fighting the battle of good versus evil. I'll keep trying to save lives even though sometimes it feels hopeless. For that reason alone, I believe that God sent me to this earth for a purpose. Whether it be to bring happiness or sadness, I don't really care. So long as I can make a difference, I'll stay on Earth and fight to the bitter end.
