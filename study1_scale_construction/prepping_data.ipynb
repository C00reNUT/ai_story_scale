      "\"I have a message for you from the president,\" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. \"He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon.\" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Marsâ€”the longest day in the year here on the planet. The air felt warm against my face as I walked down the street toward the presidential palace.\n",
      "The streets were empty except for a few people going about their daily business. I saw one old woman pushing a cart filled with vegetables, another man carrying two large bags of grain across his shoulders, and a young couple holding hands while they walked past me. As I passed them, I could see the girl looking up at me curiously. She had dark brown skin like mine but wore a white dress with purple trim. Her hair was braided tightly around her head, and she looked familiar somehow...\n",
      "A flash of memory came back to me then. When I'd first arrived on Mars, I'd been taken to a small village where I met a girl just like her. We had talked together for hours until we finally went our separate ways. But what had happened between us? Had she left me or did I leave her? And why hadn't I thought about her since then?\n",
      "My thoughts drifted away from the girl as I neared the palace. I didn't want to think about her anymore. Instead, I focused on the meeting I would be having later today with President Fisk. He wanted to discuss the possibility of establishing a permanent colony on Mars. At first, I'd been excited by the idea, but now I wasn't so sure. My mind kept returning to the girl from my memories. What if she really was important to me? If I agreed to help build a new colony on Mars, how long would I have to stay there before I could return home again? Would I even want to go back after all these years?\n",
      "As I approached the entrance to the palace, I noticed something odd. A large group of men wearing black uniforms were gathered outside the gates, talking among themselves. They seemed to be waiting for someone, but no one else was around. Curious, I stopped and watched them for a moment. One of them turned to look at me, and I recognized him immediately.\n",
      "It was General Stearn!\n",
      "I couldn't believe he was here. How had he found me? Why was he here? I stood there staring at him for several seconds before I realized that I should probably say something. So I cleared my throat nervously and called out, \"General?\"\n",
      "He turned around quickly and smiled when he saw me. \"Hello, Mr. Smith,\" he replied. \"What are you doing here?\"\n",
      "\"Dr. Sato told me that the president wants to talk to me,\" I answered.\n",
      "Stearn nodded. \"That's right. Come with me. We'll get you inside.\"\n",
      "We started walking toward the front gate, and I asked, \"How did you find me?\"\n",
      "\"I've been following your progress ever since you landed on Mars,\" he explained. \"I'm impressed by everything you're accomplishing here. You must be very proud of yourself.\"\n",
      "I laughed. \"Well, I am. I guess I never really thought about it before, but I do feel pretty good about myself. I mean, I'm not exactly like other people. Not everyone can spend five hundred years on Mars without aging a bit!\"\n",
      "Stearn chuckled. \"Yes, I suppose you're right. But don't worry too much about it. Everyone ages differently on Mars anyway. Some of us age faster than others. Yours is just a little slower.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yeah? Well, I still haven't aged a day in all this time, and I don't plan on starting anytime soon!\"\n",
      "\"Okay, okay,\" said Stearn. \"Let's drop the whole 'aging' thing. It doesn't matter. All that matters is that you're here. Now, let's get inside.\"\n",
      "Once we reached the gates, Stearn opened them for me. Inside, a soldier escorted me through the halls of the palace and into the president's office. I saw Dr. Sato sitting at a desk near the door, along with several other scientists and engineers who worked for the government. They all looked up as I entered and gave me polite smiles. I waved to them and sat down in the chair next to the president.\n",
      "President Fisk looked tired and worried. His dark hair was thinning, and his face was wrinkled like an old man's. He had a long scar running across his forehead, which made him look more intimidating than he actually was. The general leaned forward and said, \"Mr. Smith, I have some bad news for you.\"\n",
      "\"What kind of bad news?\" I asked.\n",
      "Fisk sighed and said, \"There's been a terrorist attack on Earth. Several nuclear bombs have been detonated, and most of the population has been wiped out. There are only a few survivors, and they're all hiding underground somewhere. We've lost contact with the rest of the world.\"\n",
      "\"What?!\" I gasped. \"But how could this happen? Who could possibly do such a thing?\"\n",
      "\"We don't know yet,\" answered the general. \"All we know is that it was done by someone who knew how to use the technology we developed for our colony on Mars. Whoever it was, they managed to sneak onto Earth undetected and set off the nukes before anyone could stop them.\"\n",
      "\"So, what does this mean for us?\" I asked. \"Are we safe here on Mars?\"\n",
      "\"No, unfortunately not,\" replied the president. \"This means that we need to start preparing for the worst. I've already sent a message to the UN, and they're sending a team of scientists over to investigate the situation. Once they figure out who did it, we'll be ready to move on them and put an end to their evil plans once and for all.\"\n",
      "\"Wait a minute,\" I interrupted. \"You said you'd sent a message to the UN? But I thought we weren't allowed to communicate with Earth anymore.\"\n",
      "The president frowned and shook his head. \"Not directly, no. But we can send messages to the UN through the Mars colony. That's how we got word of the attack in the first place. I figured we might as well take advantage of the fact that we're connected to Earth.\"\n",
      "\"And what will the UN do?\" I asked.\n",
      "Fisk shrugged. \"They won't be able to do anything until the investigation is complete. But I'm sure they'll come up with something. They always do.\"\n",
      "The president turned to me and asked, \"Do you have any ideas about how we should respond to this threat? Do you think we should prepare for war?\"\n",
      "\"War?\" I repeated. \"With whom? I don't understand.\"\n",
      "\"I'm sorry, Mr. Smith,\" said the president. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The participant was correct (yes/no): yes\n",

      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The tavern wasn't busy yetâ€”the weather was still warm enough for people to be outside on their balconies and in the streetsâ€”but it wouldn't take long before the place would be crowded. He was already running behind and would have to stay late to finish all his work.\n",
      "He'd been thinking about how much he didn't want to stay late. It meant missing dinner with his family. And then the girl had entered the tavern, and she hadn't been there for a meal or drink. Her face was so familiar that even though he couldn't remember seeing her before, he knew exactly who she was.\n",
      "She was the daughter of one of his father's friends. She was also the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.\n",
      "His mother had taught him what to look for in a woman, and he knew exactly when to step back from the table and let someone else sit there. When he did, she looked around and saw him watching her, and she smiled. The smile lit up her whole face. He was certain she would have winked at him if she could.\n",
      "He tried not to stare, but he couldn't help himself. He watched her every day for the rest of that summer, as she walked through the market, went down to the docks, and stood in front of the tavern window while she waited for her father to come home from work. He thought about going over to speak with her, but he knew he should wait until her father wasn't there. He'd heard how he treated women.\n",
      "He kept telling himself that he would ask her out soon enough. But time passed, and he didn't ask. The next year, she was gone, and he never saw her again.\n",
      "That was the summer that he realized what his father meant by saying that you shouldn't fall in love too quickly. Love was like an ocean wave: it crashed into your heart and took hold of it. There was no getting away from it once it had touched you.\n",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" he said, as he reached the door. \"My father's not home.\"\n",
      "The girl smiled and nodded. She was still smiling as she turned and walked out of the room.\n",
      "\"You'll need to see my father about this,\" the girl said, as she stepped outside.\n",
      "\"What are you talking about?\" asked the boy, who was now a man.\n",
      "The girl laughed. \"You've been here all afternoon, and I haven't seen him once. What are you doing here? Do you live in this building?\"\n",
      "The man shook his head. \"No, but he is my father.\"\n",
      "\"Oh!\" The girl frowned and then shrugged. \"Well, if you want to talk to him, you'll need to do it in the morning. He leaves very early, so he can make it back home before dark.\"\n",
      "\"He's going to be angry with me.\"\n",
      "\"Don't worry about it. Just go home.\"\n",
      "\"Thanks. Good night.\"\n",
      "The boy turned to leave and then stopped when the girl called out to him.\n",
      "\"Wait. You forgot your money.\"\n",
      "He looked down at the table where the coins had been. They were gone. He hadn't taken them, but they must have slipped off the table somehow. He reached out and picked up the money and put it into his pocket.\n",
      "\"Good night,\" he said.\n",
      "As he left the room, he thought about how much he wanted to stay. But he knew that his father would be angry with him for staying late. So instead of returning to work, he walked down the hall to the front door, where he found a young boy standing there. The boy was holding the key to the apartment next door.\n",
      "\"My name is Omer,\" he said. \"Do you know where I might find Mr. Zebedee?\"\n",
      "The man smiled and nodded. \"You're lucky. He's not home yet, so you won't get in trouble.\"\n",
      "The boy's eyes lit up as he realized what that meant. \"Thank you!\" he said. Then he ran down the stairs and across the street.\n",
      "The man watched him go, then locked the front door and went back into the tavern. He took out his keys and unlocked the door to his father's office, which was on the first floor. He stepped inside and shut the door behind him, then sat down in his father's chair. He leaned forward and placed his elbows on the desk and rested his forehead in his hands. He closed his eyes and tried to think of something other than what had just happened, but no matter how hard he tried, all he could see was her face.\n",
      "She was beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, and it hung in long curls around her shoulders. She was tall and slender, with a small waist and wide hips. When she laughed, he thought her eyes sparkled like two blue jewels. And when he looked at her, he couldn't help but smile.\n",
      "He wondered if she still lived in the building. He didn't remember seeing any children in the neighborhood who looked like her. Maybe they were from one of the neighboring villages. Or maybe she was someone's daughter, but they weren't married yet. That would explain why she hadn't come home with her father.\n",
      "The longer he thought about it, the more excited he became. He knew he needed to speak to his father in the morning before he left for work. He would find out everything there was to know about her. He hoped she would be there waiting for him.\n",
      "And then, as if she had heard his thoughts, she appeared in the doorway. He couldn't believe it. His heart jumped up into his throat. He couldn't even speak. He stood up and took a step toward her, and she smiled at him. He felt himself falling into her eyes, and he wondered if he'd ever been this happy in his life.\n",
      "He wanted to say something to her, but he didn't know what to say. So instead, he held out a handful of coins.\n",
      "\"I need to see my father,\" he said, \"but I have this money.\"\n",
      "She reached out and took the coins from his hand. Then she put them in her pocket.\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" he said, as he stepped closer to her.\n",
      "She nodded and turned to go. Before she got out of the room, she looked back over her shoulder at him.\n",
      "\"Good luck,\" she said.\n",
      "He smiled. She smiled. It was enough for him.\n",
      "It wasn't long after that he met her father. Her father was a tall, thin man who wore a beard and mustache that made him look like a pirate. He also had a long, bushy mustache. His hair was dark brown and pulled into a ponytail. \n",

It was already noon on Marsâ€”the longest day in the year here on the planet. Today, however, would be shorter than usual because of the eclipse, which was due to happen later today. The next time we'd have a full solar eclipse on Mars, it would be in two years. I got into the aircar, which I'd driven to work all of one other time since moving here. There was a line of cars parked along the road waiting to take people across the crater to their homes or offices. I recognized some of the facesâ€”some were crew who lived here, and others were students like me who had been recruited by the government. When you moved to Mars, they sent you an aircar. It was a lot cheaper than flying yourself, though it was still expensive.\n",
      "The car picked up speed as soon as I hit the throttle and started toward the city center. We drove over a small ridge and down toward the edge of the crater where I could see a series of craters with the famous white dome of Olympus Mons rising above them. Some of the craters had little houses around them, but most were empty. Many of the residents lived inside the crater in domes that were far bigger than the ones that housed us here on the surface. A few domes were occupied by families, while others held various government agencies and scientific research facilities. I'd never understood why there wasn't a city built underground to save energy and protect against radiation. If a big rock came crashing down from space, the city would probably be crushed by the force of the impact.\n",
      "We turned south and flew over a patch of dark brown sand before circling around to the east where I could see a cluster of buildings on a low hill. It was my house. It was smaller than I had expected, which I thought was strange because of the fact that it sat right next to one of the largest lakes on Mars. The lake itself was the size of a large pond in Michigan, and the house was on a small island in the middle of it. The water looked calm, but I knew that there were dozens of different kinds of dangerous things living in the lake, such as leeches, poisonous jellyfish, and various fish. When I got home, I'd need to do a full inspection of the house to make sure that the various windows and doors were still intact, and that all of the solar panels were functioning properly. I hadn't been here in months, so I didn't really know what to expect.\n",
      "The aircar slowed down as we approached the house. I looked out the window at my father standing by the side of the house as he waited for me. He smiled when he saw me looking, but then his face fell, and a look of sadness came over his face. A man that I assumed to be my father's new wife walked toward him and gave him a hug, and I could tell from her body language that she was happy to see him. I got out of the car, and my dad gave me a small wave before walking toward the house. The woman was standing at the front door, and as soon as she saw me, she turned around and started running back down the hill. My heart sank.\n",
      "I looked back to see my mother sitting on the front steps of the house. She stood up when she saw me and waved. I smiled and waved back. There was no reason to be sad, though. This was probably going to be my new family. My new life on Mars. I hoped that they wouldn't keep me locked away like some kind of prisoner. I just wanted to live my life without any hassle.\n",
      "We walked into the house together, and the woman followed us inside. \"Hi, I'm Ann. It's nice to meet you,\" the woman said to me. \"We have some food if you'd like to eat.\"\n",
      "\"I appreciate it,\" I said.\n",
      "\"So, this is your son?\" she asked my father.\n",
      "\"Yes, he's going to stay here with us,\" my father replied. I had already heard the story of how I was discovered, but I still didn't understand how a little kid like me ended up here on Mars.\n",
      "My mother went upstairs while Ann took me into the kitchen where there were several different things that I could smell. It smelled like pork and potatoes. \"It's lunchtime, so let me get your plate ready. You're hungry, aren't you?\" she said, opening up one of the cupboards. She pulled out a bag of potato chips and put them on the counter. \"What do you like to eat, Yuri?\"\n",
      "\"I love pizza,\" I replied.\n",
      "\"That sounds perfect!\" she said, getting some plates and silverware out of another cabinet. I watched as she put on some kind of sauce, which she then used to coat the top of a big piece of bread. Then she placed slices of meat in the center and topped it off with cheese before placing the whole thing on a baking sheet. When she was done, she put it into the oven and set the timer.\n",
      "\"Do you like sports? I can take you to watch a basketball game later if you want.\" She handed me two slices of pizza, which were both warm by the time we got outside again. \"How about I call a taxi and have him drop us off at the stadium?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, please,\" I replied.\n",
      "She took a seat next to me on the grass outside as I ate. Ann smiled as we chatted. \"How is school?\" she asked. \"Are you excited to start your program?\"\n",
      "\"I think I'm going to like it here,\" I replied. \"Maybe even more than Earth.\"\n",
      "\"That's good,\" she said. \"I hope you get along with your classmates.\"\n",
      "\"I'm not really sure yet,\" I admitted. \"There are only six of us in my class, so it's going to be hard to get to know them.\"\n",
      "\"Well, you'll definitely make friends once you've been here a while. You're very cute, so you should have no problem,\" Ann said with a smile. I couldn't help but blush as she spoke, and I had the urge to reach up and touch my hair. It was just so long.\n",
      "After lunch, Ann asked me if I wanted to come with her to do some shopping in town. We hopped into the car and started driving east.\n",
      "\"Do you have a boyfriend?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"Not that I know of,\" I replied.\n",
      "\"You don't date much?\"\n",
      "\"I guess not,\" I said, thinking back to high school. I hadn't dated a lot. There was one boy that I liked, but he didn't go to my school. He'd gotten in trouble for cheating on tests, which I thought was ridiculous. The only reason I was interested in him at all was because I had a crush on his older brother. But it turned out that I wasn't supposed to know who his brothers were. That's why the teachers let him leave school early to hang out with me after class. I never learned who his real family was, and neither did he. \n",

      "The participant was correct (yes/no): no\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...someone working in a tavern. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "\"I have a message for you from the president,\" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. \"He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon.\" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Marsâ€”the longest day in the year here on the planet. I had a long drive ahead of me, but as always, I enjoyed the time alone in the car. There were so many things I wanted to ask Sato about her recent visit to Earth, but she was being cagey and hadn't given me much information. The only thing I knew for sure is that there were no aliens involved in this meeting.\n",
      "I drove up to the presidential estate in the center of Mars City, where I parked next to a dozen other vehicles in the parking lot. After walking through the security checkpoint, I went inside the main entrance where several people were waiting. One looked familiar, but after a few more moments of staring I realized it was Dr. Sato who greeted me warmly. She led me through another set of doors and down some stairs that would lead us outside to a large courtyard surrounded by buildings. A couple of soldiers stood guard at one end, scanning everyone who entered. They wore armor, carried rifles, and kept their eyes locked on each person passing by them. I had never seen such militarized guards before. The president must be very serious about keeping this place secure, I thought as we walked across the courtyard towards a set of glass double doors. We stopped when we reached the doorway and waited until two men carrying briefcases came out first. One was wearing the standard suit of clothes, while the other wore a full lab coat and had glasses hanging around his neck. He also held a briefcase in one hand. Sato introduced them both as Mr. O'Malley and Professor Kuznetsov. When they saw me, Professor Kuznetsov smiled broadly. \"You are even more impressive than your file claimed,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" I replied. He was tall with graying hair, and seemed to have the kindest eyes. As I studied him a bit closer, I noticed his skin was quite white compared to everyone else in the room. It was also covered with a thick layer of red patches and blotches that resembled the red dust from Mars. Even so, he still didn't look any different than I did, except perhaps healthier. His face was smooth, and his hands had no wrinkles or age spots. I wondered if I could have the same sort of longevity treatment when I grew old.\n",
      "We continued walking past the security guards and through another set of double doors until we reached a large oval-shaped conference table sitting in the middle of the room. Sitting across from me were President Anderson and Dr. Sato. I sat down next to Professor Kuznetsov, who offered me a smile before turning back to President Anderson.\n",
      "\"Please, be seated,\" President Anderson told me as he pulled out the chair next to him.\n",
      "As we began talking, I found out Dr. Sato was actually a woman named Yuki Sato. Apparently she was born on Earth and had spent most of her life working in labs there. She was an expert on human cloningâ€”which I found surprising since I didn't think anyone else even knew it was possible. She started telling me how she met Professor Kuznetsov on Earth and they worked together to perfect the technology needed to clone a human body. Then, using the same process, they created artificial bodies that could survive in Martian conditions and function just like normal humans. The first one was made for President Anderson himself.\n",
      "\"What about this?\" asked Dr. Sato, pointing to the red patch on my arm that was visible beneath my shirt sleeve. I looked down and saw that it appeared to have gotten bigger during our discussion.\n",
      "\"It doesn't concern us,\" answered President Anderson. \"If your skin color has anything to do with this then you're welcome to stay here as long as you wish.\" He paused, looking at me for a moment. \"So what exactly are you here for?\"\n",
      "\"I was hoping to find out where your people have come from,\" I replied. \"How they got to Mars and why they want to destroy all of humanity.\"\n",
      "Dr. Sato interrupted with a raised hand. \"We already know that, but I don't see how we can help you,\" she said.\n",
      "President Anderson smiled and nodded. \"Well, Dr. Sato, I'm afraid this young man is right. We know very little about how these aliens arrived here or where they came from.\" He looked over at me, and then turned back to Dr. Sato. \"I suppose if they were willing to give up all their secrets, you would probably want them to stay here with us forever,\" he added.\n",
      "\"No, sir, I wouldn't,\" I replied with a sigh.\n",
      "\"Then let me explain something to you,\" said President Anderson, leaning forward in his chair and speaking in a low voice. \"This isn't the first alien attack we've suffered. It seems as though they are targeting only certain countries that seem important somehow to our society. We know the Chinese attacked us a few years ago. Our government wasn't prepared, but fortunately the aliens couldn't figure out how to get through their military defenses. However, there have been attacks against our neighbors to the south.\"\n",
      "The president's words surprised me. The Mexican president? I wondered if they were related somehow to Dr. Sato. Maybe they were all connected. Or maybe they weren't even the same people at all, but some other species living in Mexico. If that was true, then perhaps I really was dealing with a new species of alien that was able to communicate with humans and manipulate their minds.\n",
      "\"That doesn't make sense,\" I said, shaking my head slowly. \"Why haven't they attacked us again? Why aren't they attacking the US directly?\"\n",
      "\"Maybe we have something they want,\" suggested Professor Kuznetsov from next to me. \"Maybe that's why they haven't destroyed us completely. They want us to surrender or die.\"\n",
      "I shook my head and stared back at President Anderson. \"You're lying.\"\n",
      "\"Are you sure?\" he asked. \"Do you have any proof of what you claim?\"\n",
      "I sighed again and looked away from him. \"You won't believe me if I tell you anyway. You're going to say it's all in my head.\"\n",
      "\"All right,\" he replied, standing up from the table and putting his arms behind his back. \"Let us prove to you that this isn't all in your head, young man.\" He turned to Professor Kuznetsov. \"Please ask him to leave this room while we prepare some samples for testing.\"\n",
      "Professor Kuznetsov nodded and got up from his chair, leaving us alone in the conference room. The president followed him out of the room, closing the door behind him, and turned around to face me again. \"I have no idea what you are talking about, but if you are saying these creatures have some connection with us, then it must be true.\" He walked towards the windows overlooking the courtyard to one side of the room before stopping near a large cabinet against the wall. \n",
