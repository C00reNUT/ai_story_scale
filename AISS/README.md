# AI Story Scale (AISS)
The AI Story Scale (AISS) is currently the only questionnaire for rating AI stories based on [empirical analysis](../v1/aiss_v1.md). It should provide a robust instrument to understand how different language models and settings influence people's experience of the resulting story output.

I will try to slowly improve and expand this scale with new data. This site will link to the current version of the AISS:
