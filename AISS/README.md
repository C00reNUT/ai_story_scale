# AI Story Scale (AISS)
The AI Story Scale (AISS) is currently the only questionnaire for rating AI stories based on [empirical analysis](https://github.com/MWiechmann/transformer_story_scale). It should provide a robust instrument to understand how different language models and settings influence people's experience of the resulting story output.

I will try to slowly improve and expand this scale with new data. This site will link to the current version of the AISS:

[AISS v1](v1/aiss_v1.md)

## How to cite the AISS
Go to the [main page of the repo](https://github.com/MWiechmann/ai_story_scale). Look to the right to the 'About' field. Click the line that says 'Cite this repository'.
